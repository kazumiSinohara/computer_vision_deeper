Description:

First thing I did was to load the test and train images on ot google colab,
I got the csv with the ground truth, encoded the labels using scikit-learn into integers then encoded into numpy arrays using keras.

Then I trained the CIFAR10 model using 6 epochs and no data augmentation.

Using the trained model, I applied it to the test images and got the respective prediction in string format (using the inverse transformation
from the sckit-learn label encoder). With that information I built a pandas dataframe with the name of the image and its predicted label.

Finally, I built a dictionary linking each possible label to a function which would rotate and correct the orientation of the images,
together with the dataframe containing the predicted label I was able to correct the test image orientation.

The very last step was to concatenate the corrected test images and the corrected train images in a numpy array.


Improviments:

The test accuracy of this model was above 98%, so I wouldnt change the model itself but I would try and improve on how
the data is being fed to the model. Instead of loading all the train data upfront to the memory it would be better
to have the system take small batches from the hard disk. Because it could be the case that this data wouldnt fit in memory
then we would run into trouble.
